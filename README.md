# üåπ The Hatchlor üåπ Cookiecutter Template

The Hatchlor is a [cookiecutter] template featuring the modern and extensible Python project manager [hatch] üê£.

## ‚ú® Features

The Hatchlor integrates the following features:

* [hatch]: Python packaging, environment management and test runner ([tox] replacement),
* [hatch-vcs]: determine the package version automatically from git tags, e.g. `v0.9`,
* [pytest]: full-featured Python testing tool that helps you write better programs,
* [coverage]: tool for measuring code coverage of Python programs with pytest integration,
* [ruff]: extremely fast Python linter, which replaces [isort], [flake8], etc.,
* [mypy]: optional static type checker for Python,
* [black]: the uncompromising Python code formatter everyone loves,
* [mkdocs]: a fast, simple and downright gorgeous static site generator,
* [pre-commit]: pre-commit git hooks that make your life easier,
* [Markdown]: instead of reStructuredText, Markdown is used consistently for all text files,
* [EditorConfig]: maintain consistent coding styles for multiple developers,
* [src-layout]: the actual Python package is kept under a `src` folder avoiding many common errors.

The template includes a `skeleton.py` with a simple function `fib` that calculates the Fibonacci numbers
as demonstration. This is tested with `tests/test_skeleton.py` to demonstrate the corresponding features
from above. As an additional tidbit, `skeleton.py` also features [Typer] to show how `fib` can be
exposed as a CLI command. These files are only for demonstration and can be safely deleted.

## üí´ Quickstart

Install the latest [cookiecutter], i.e. >= 1.4, if not installed:

```console
pip install -U cookiecutter
```

Then generate your Python project with:

```console
cookiecutter https://github.com/florianwilhelm/the-hatchlor.git
```

üéâ That's  it! You can now change into the created directory and check out `README.md` for more.
